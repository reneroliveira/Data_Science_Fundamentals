# Data Science Fundamentals

Homeworks made for Data Science Fundamentals MSc subject. Course materials were based on Havard's Fall Course [CS109a: Introduction to Data Science](https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2019-CS109A/).

I've also worked with two other colleagues on the [Hurricane Project](https://github.com/reneroliveira/Hurricane_Project) which was the course's final project. Click on the link to check it out!
